THIS IS A MVP DOCUMENT - FOR POTENTIAL MOBILE GAMEPLAY AS FOR TECHNOLOGY I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT. 

* This one will be portrait, with Input -> joystick movement, releasing and as a button
* Gameplay must convince the player to want more power and different ways to beat the levels, but not necessarily implement all progression at once.
* RPG progression must be easy to implement (Diablo 3 / fusion) and generous, BUT it can be an abstract layer for the game.
* Ownership comes from movement and attack strategy
	* You move and the game will tell you what you could do depending of enemy reach
	* Bayonetta’s crazy-but-strategic attack style: button smashing works, but dodge and timing works better.
* Three “attack” choices, the player will need to mix them and modifying them, as Diablo3’s runes
* No story directly explained but “something weird is going on”: nier auto + ghost in the shell’s what the fuck is going on here feeling.
* Lots of camera, lost of anim triggers and VFX
* Model must be allowed to be swapped: you are an avatar.
* With a pet! It must work as a pod from NierAuto
